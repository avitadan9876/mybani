    <h1>The Story of Two Birds</h1>
    <p>
        Like water reflects the face, so one’s life reflects the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two birds were born from the same nest, carried by the same wind.
        Though they looked alike, each had a different song within.
        One flew freely, curious and bright, while the other lingered,
        cautious, quietly watching. One day, their paths crossed mid-air,
        and for the first time, they saw in each other a reflection
        not just of wings or feathers, but of longing, love, and the sky between.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so they flew, not one after the other, but side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
        — For Avital, always reflected in the calmest skies.
